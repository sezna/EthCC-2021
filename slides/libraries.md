#### Libraries


Note: 
In solidity, libraries are deployed to the chain and code is reused via a `DELEGATECALL`. They work like a contract call, except the 
contract context refers to the calling contract, not the called contract. This has a few downsides.

----

1. Libraries are difficult to upgrade.
1. Libraries can be expensive to use.
1. Deployed libraries are hard to inspect.


----
```rust
library math;

pub fn exponentiate(a: u64, b: u64) -> u64 {
  let mut ret = a;
  for a in 0..b {
    ret = ret * a
  }
  ret
}

```

Note: Public functions, structs, traits, etc. declared in a library can be directly imported and baked into the deployed code generated by Sway.
This means that library versioning is easy, the code is inspectable. If your contract exceeds the maximum deployable amount, then we automatically
chop it up and handle the calls between them.
